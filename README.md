# **ESP8266_MQTT_Cloud_Connect**

_Introduction_
---
Home automation systems have revolutionized the way we manage and control our living spaces. With the advent of the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, these systems have become even more efficient and interconnected. This project explores the motivations and benefits of using MQTT in home automation, highlighting its role in streamlining connectivity and control. Additionally, it delves into the implementation of over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates, which further enhance the functionality and ease of maintenance in a smart home setup.


This is an `MQTT` connect Code

```
while (!client.connected()) {
    Serial.printf("The client %s connects to the mqtt broker\n", client_id);
    if (client.connect(client_id, mqtt_username, mqtt_password)) {
        Serial.println("Connected to MQTT broker.");
        client.subscribe(mqtt_topic_sub_01);
    } else {
        Serial.print("Failed to connect to MQTT broker, rc=");
        Serial.print(client.state());
        Serial.println(" Retrying in 5 seconds.");
        delay(5000);
    }
```
